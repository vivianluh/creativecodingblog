During the beginning of my creative coding journey, I decided to unpack a variety of different Javascript concepts, ready to be utilised in p5. To do this, I summarised each concept exposed during the class lectures in my own words while also referring to a variety of online tutorials, such as through [the coding train]( https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) and [Bill Raymond]( https://www.youtube.com/c/WilliamRaymondPM). In turn, this has helped me immensely to wrap my head around key Javascript concepts.

#   Variables 
In my own words, I have discovered that variables are a named key word that stores some sought of information, data, or value. Like ‘function’ you can assign whatever name to a variable by declaring it through `let__()`.

#   Functions 
I would utilise functions to categorise actions, or things we want to happen in a way that is divided from each other in a structured way, however when combined become a package. I believe functions are easy when you want to test different actions in a concise manner in `function__()`. Like variables, you can also define a function however you want.

#   Classes 
I would describe a class a template with the idea to encapsulate the idea of data and functionality into an object. In some sense, ‘class’ allows us to describe what it means to be that object. Different to functions, functions is like a behaviour, to  `move`, to  `bounce`, or to  `display` for that object, while classes are like blueprints of that object.

#   Conditional Logic 
Another phrase to describe Conditional Logic is through the Boolean Expression, which conveys the meaning that something is either true or false/1 or 0. By adding conditional logic operations to your code, you can invite more interactivity onto the page. For example, on your piece of code, if you state that something is true, this will be the consequence of that truth, it will appear after that code is ran.

#   Arrays 
When thinking about interactivity on a larger scale, arrays can be utilised to invite this. To me, Arrays are lists of values that allow you to refer to a variety of values, data, and information.

#   Iteration
While watching a variety of different coding tutorials, I noted that Arrays and Iteration are used together quite often. Apart from the `frameCount()` variable, in order to invite iteration, the `for()` loop is also utilised to construct repetitive forms. An interesting thing to note, and I'm not sure if this is true, but the `for()` expressions also utilise `<` which is also seen in use when applying conditional logic.
