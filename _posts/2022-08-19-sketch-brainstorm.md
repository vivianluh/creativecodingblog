When deciding how I would go about the creation and design of my p5 sketch banner, I
started off with a simple brainstorm that made sure to reference some of the javascript concepts we went over during the class lectures, as well as through the 
[the coding train]( https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) tutorials.

I have utilised the RMIT branding styleguide as the foundation to how I would 
design my banner as I believe this will give a clear and recognisable representation
of RMIT. In order to represent the concepts of creative coding, I aim to implement a variety of different user interactivity, especially with the use of the user's mouse.
