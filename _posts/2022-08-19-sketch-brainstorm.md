To begin utilising the concepts I have learnt in class to improve on the banner design, I employed the ‘ideate’ design thinking technique of mind mapping to form a clear direction of how I would apply various Javascript concepts to my banner and what I was aiming for visually in the end result. The mind map below defines my overall presentation idea for the banner, with the aim of referencing the 6 Javascript concepts, as well as utilising various coding tips, tricks and new functions introduced through the [the coding train]( https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) tutorials mentioned previously.

Take note that the banner idea I aim to put forward is heavily inspired by the official RMIT style guide, such as the use of colour, font, and logo design. The aim is to offer an RMIT styled banner design that is appeals to users in a vibrant manner while also maintaining a sense of professionalism. I will also consider implementing user interactivity to encourage engagement, such as through the user’s mouse.
