To further apply the various concepts, I have learnt over the course of the class lectures, I have ideated a design outcome for a piece of ‘Net Art’ utilising Javascript, interaction, and audio in the static site. Apart from brainstorming a concept, I further researched on the art topic of ‘net art’ itself, and to my response the medium is considered to be a somewhat anarchic process with its nature being described as [chameleonic]( https://magazine.artland.com/agents-of-change-internet-net-art-how-the-world-wide-web-has-affected-the-way-we-make-art/), with no strict aesthetic it follows but instead a process that evolves and adapts according to our social, technological, and cultural changes. 

# Ideating – Brainstorm 
Below I have included the brainstorm for my concept development and the idea I wish to achieve by the end of the assignment.

The concept is heavily inspired by QianQian Ye’s project [Superwoman]( https://qianqian-ye.com/superwoman.html), and I hopefully aim to utilise the techniques and interactions featured in ‘Superwoman’ to better my overall piece.
