Assignment 2 of my creative coding journey aims to draw upon Javascript concepts and apply them in a variety of different ways to create an interactive piece of net art. My net art piece is titled ‘The Travelling Soot’, which draws inspiration from the [Susuwatari](https://ghibli.fandom.com/wiki/Susuwatari) (すすワタリ) or ‘Travelling Soot’ in the film ‘Spirited Away’. The interactive site aims to invite a sense of nostalgia, especially for those who are familiar with the Studio Ghibli films, for which these soot characters appear often. Apart from nostalgia, the interactivity between the soot spirits and the colour changing star cursor aims to convey a sense of playfulness. 

# Interactivity x Visual Elements
I believe a large part of inviting that sense of playfulness and fun, the objective was to match the various interactions between the user and its visual elements to the way the soot spirits are seen in the films itself. I unpacked the way the soot spirits moved, interacted with its surroundings, looked like, and its diet when linking user interactivity with these elements. 

-	Soot sprites get extremely jittery and ecstatically excited when they are fed Kompeito (a Japanese hard candy in the shape of a star). The soots are seen getting fed yellow, pink, and green coloured Kompeito.
-	The cursor is a colour changing star for which a large group of Soot sprites constantly follow the cursor and gather on top of each other as they close in on the star. 
-	The user can press any key on the keyboard, and this will prompt all the soot sprites to go crazily excited for the Kompeito. 

# Sound
During the development of this assignment, I also worked on experimenting with audio and sound. To further invite that sense of nostalgia within the site, I wanted users to experience the interactions between the soot and the cursor with this iconic [piece](https://youtu.be/TK1Ij_-mank) from ‘Spirited Away’. This was key in allowing users to really get a feel for the atmosphere as they interact with the site. With this, I decided to employ a small audio visualiser towards the side of the site, where users can start and pause the music as they click anywhere on the site. The audio visualiser allows users to see when the song is being played/when it is not, giving them control over what they want to see and hear. I thought this was a neat idea when working with the audio and visual elements, where the visualiser is not the main attraction of the site but is aimed to work fluidly with the interactions. 

# Instructions
Instructions were also placed in the centre to introduce the site’s purpose and guide users easily through the different interactions up for offer.
