# Community of Practise

The Community of Practise I wish to frame this final creative coding presentation through is to my brother named Justin. When developing the concept of this project, a variety of different aspects are to be considered when creating my project for him. Justin currently lives in a one-bedroom apartment by himself in Sydney, away from home back in Melbourne. He is currently working full time as a creative producer and much of his work is spent editing at his desk. His interests include playing video games, reading, and streaming for which he is called ‘chipotle’ on it (just to name a few). As I wish to create something personalised for him, I will consider these aspects when developing my concept.

# Domain
The domain I will focus on is his desk space where he spends much of his time weekly at work. This domain is a quiet space that invites productive work.  

# Repetoire
Much of the repertoire will be spent sitting down at his desk working. One thing I have noticed is that Justin has a smaller monitor at his desk, for which he will put something on in the background while he is working to fill the empty space. 

# Values
Key values to consider when working at his desk includes a space which invites creativity, and motivation. A stress-free environment where he needs to be calm and collected with his thoughts are also vital to encourage motivation and resilience while working. Another aspect to consider is that because Justin does not live at home, it would be nice to create a project that brings a sense of home to him and sentimentality towards the home he grew up in. This would further establish a peaceful atmosphere for him. 

# Idea

I wish to create a simple interactive animated artwork inspired by [lo-fi girl](https://youtu.be/jfKfPfyJRdk) which shows a cartooned version of my brother working at his desk at night (while Justin’s repertoire will usually be him situated at his desk at work, the artwork will mirror his desk space he usually uses back at home in his room). Bring in little clues/objects that mean a great deal to him that are situated back in his room down in Melbourne. Through mouse hover, various objects start to animate, while relaxing music is played in the background. 

Ojects/trinkets that mean a lot to him that are at home in his room/are funny:
- Chipotle neon sign (hover over to light up)
- Plush king dedede 
- Megaman card I made him when he was young 
- Big fan he uses to cool down his overheating desktop

Things he likes/he does:
- McDonalds
- Nintendo Switch 
- Stays up late all the time (a night owl/I don't think he sleeps)
- Editing videos
- Reading
