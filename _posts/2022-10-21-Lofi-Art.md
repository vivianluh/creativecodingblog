To begin developing my lo-fi inspired animated artwork, I researched the key elements that are true to what lo-fi aesthetics look like. Limited colour palette, confined setting, and a character is an extremely important aspect of lo-fi art and this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/hRtZzSB0Ojw) helped develop the overall aesthetic of the artwork.

# Illustrations using Procreate 
I utilised procreate to illustrate the overall artwork of my brother at his desk working. This process was completed combining layers together into a hierarchy while also following a strict, limited colour palette to create a night-time atmosphere.

# Animating 
The plan is to utilise gifs to create simple animations that can play on a mouse hover. As I am planning the development of my moving artwork, HTML and CSS coding languages will be fitting when layering different elements on top of each other and the CSS hover function will be a clean way to animate the elements together and present the whole artwork is a moving image. When working this out, a [play gif on hover tutorial](https://youtu.be/6H2bowOpFRw) is to be referenced when coding all elements into HTML and CSS pages.
